This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Activity Performance Dashboard** - An AI-powered sales activity tracking system that transforms social media conversation screenshots into actionable performance insights. Instead of predicting sales outcomes (which is hard), we track **activity levels** - because successful salespeople know they need "1 more call, 1 more text, talk to 1 more person."

## Core Value Proposition

Transform scattered conversation screenshots into a powerful activity performance dashboard that helps sales professionals stay consistent, organized, and motivated in their daily outreach efforts.

## Target Users & User Stories

### **Primary User: Sales Professional**
*"I need to track my daily sales activities to stay motivated and hit my targets"*

**User Stories:**
- "As a salesperson, I want to upload multiple screenshots at once so I can quickly process my daily conversations"
- "As a user, I want to see if conversations are Hot/Warm/Cold so I can prioritize follow-ups"
- "As a professional, I want to organize activities into contacts so I can build relationships"
- "As a goal-oriented person, I want to see my activity streaks and performance metrics"

### **Secondary User: Sales Manager**
*"I need visibility into my team's activity levels, not just outcomes"*

**User Stories:**
- "As a manager, I want to see team activity dashboards to coach effectively"
- "As a leader, I want to track activity trends across different platforms"

## Tech Stack

## Database Schema

### **Core Tables:**
- **activities**: Raw conversation data from screenshots with Hot/Warm/Cold temperature
- **contacts**: Organized people/relationships with performance metrics  
- **screenshots**: Original images with AI analysis results for traceability

### **Data Model:**
```typescript
interface Activity {
  id: number
  screenshot_id?: number
  person_name: string
  phone?: string
  platform: string
  message_content?: string
  message_from?: string

  contact_id?: number // Links to organized contact
  created_at: string
  updated_at?: string
}

interface Contact {
  id: number
  name: string
  phone?: string
  platforms: string[] // Array of platforms they use
  relationship_status: 'new' | 'active' | 'converted' | 'dormant'
  relationship_type?: 'family' | 'friend' | 'stranger' | 'referral' | 'existing_customer'
  last_contact_date?: string
  contact_attempts: number
  response_rate: number

## Temperature System (Hot/Warm/Cold)

### **Philosophy:**
Replaced complex 1-10 numeric scoring with simple 3-level temperature system for intuitive prioritization.

### **Temperature Definitions:**
- **üî• Hot**: Recent active conversation, person asking questions or showing strong interest
- **üå°Ô∏è Warm**: Normal conversation, some engagement (default for most interactions)
- **‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold**: Old messages, one-word responses, or minimal engagement

### **Implementation:**
- AI automatically assigns temperature during screenshot analysis
- Users can override temperature during review process
- Visual badges with emojis for immediate recognition
- No complex scoring logic - just simple categorical prioritization

## Multi-Screenshot Processing

### **Batch Upload Features:**
- Drag-and-drop multiple files simultaneously
- Visual file preview with thumbnails
- Platform override dropdown per screenshot
- Real-time processing status for each file
- Error handling and retry capabilities

### **Platform Organization:**
- Dynamic tabs based on detected platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
- Group chat detection with visual warnings
- Bulk operations per platform (exclude all group chats, etc.)
- Platform-specific review workflows

### **Review Interface:**
- Activities organized by platform tabs
- Temperature dropdown for each activity
- Bulk editing capabilities
- Smart group chat filtering
- Custom toast notifications for feedback

## Environment Variables

```bash
