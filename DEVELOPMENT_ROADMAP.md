## Session Planning

Each development session should focus on completing one high-priority item completely rather than partially implementing multiple features. This ensures a stable, usable product at each stage while building toward the full vision.

**Recommended Session Order**:
1. Lead Editing â†’ Search â†’ Export â†’ Dashboard â†’ Follow-up Reminders
2. Then tackle lower priority items based on user feedback and usage patterns

**Success Metrics**:
- User engagement with new features
- Reduction in manual data entry time
- Improved lead conversion rates
- User satisfaction feedback
